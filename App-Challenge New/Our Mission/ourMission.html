                        <p class="text">We noticed that because of the pandemic, a large part of the American population is overweight or obese because of lack of physical movement. This increases the threat of heart disease and disorders/diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and more. Along with this, some children are not growing to their expected height because of a sedentary lifestyle. Our goal with this app is to help people reach their desired weight and let them know what their expected adult HEIGHT is. If our app helps even one person, it will all be worth it!
