    activity level, and target weight loss/gain. Now you can see how many calories you should consume a day!

  <h2>How the calculator works</h2>
  <p class="text3">
    This calculator works by taking in your height, weight, age, gender, your activity level (Sedentary, Lightly Active,
    Moderately Active, Very Active, and Extremely Active), and your target weight loss/gain. If you are using the
    imperial system, behind the scenes it converts weight and height into metric. Then it uses the following formula.
    Boys: 66.5 + (13.75 * weight) + (5.003 * height) - (6.75 * age). Girls: 655.1 + (9.563 * weight) + (1.850 *
    height) - (4.676 * age). Then, it multiplies the value depending on your activity level. If your activity level is
    sedentary, the value is multiplied by 1.2. Lightly active is 1.375, moderately active is 1.55, continually active
    is 1.725, and extra active is 1.9. It then takes how many pounds/kgs you want to lose/gain and adjusts the number of
    calories you lose/gain by a factor of 500.
